# Agentic AI Projects

This repository contains a collection of Agentic AI projects, each designed to explore different aspects of agent-based artificial intelligence. The projects are implemented in Python and demonstrate various techniques and concepts in the field of AI.

## Projects

### Financial Agent

The Financial Agent project focuses on creating an AI agent capable of performing financial analysis and making investment decisions. It utilizes various financial data sources and machine learning algorithms to analyze market trends and predict future performance.

#### Files

-   `financial_agent.py`: The main script for the Financial Agent. It contains the core logic for data analysis, decision-making, and interaction with financial APIs.
-   `playground.py`: A script for testing and experimenting with new features and algorithms for the Financial Agent.

#### Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the `Financial Agent` directory.
4. Install the required dependencies using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r ../requirements.txt
    ```

#### Usage

To run the Financial Agent, execute the following command in the `Financial Agent` directory:

```bash
python financial_agent.py
```

### PDF Assistant

The PDF Assistant project aims to develop an AI agent that can assist with processing and extracting information from PDF documents. It leverages natural language processing and computer vision techniques to understand the content and structure of PDFs.

#### Files

-   `pdf_assistant.py`: The main script for the PDF Assistant. It includes functionalities for parsing PDF files, extracting text and data, and performing analysis on the extracted information.

#### Installation

2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the `PDF Assistant` directory.
4. Install the required dependencies using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r ../requirements.txt
    ```

#### Usage

To run the PDF Assistant, execute the following command in the `PDF Assistant` directory:

```bash
python pdf_assistant.py
```

## Dependencies

Both projects share a common set of dependencies, which are listed in the `requirements.txt` file at the root of the repository. These dependencies can be installed using pip:
